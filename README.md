### APSSDC_finalproject


**Project Abstract**

Our project Quiz Buckers is a responsive web page which allows different users to attend a Quiz, questions about basic general knowledge and some about html,css,js,etc. Initially when a user enters into a main page login page will appear, the user is asked for username and password and then entering correct credentials user is allowed to enter the second page, in which user needs to select no of questions he would like to attend from range of  0 to 30. And Submitting no of questions, the user is willing to take a test, Third page will be loaded  which has questions and the user will select the options which he thinks are correct. Now the user can submit the quiz, after submitting the quiz user score will be displayed. Only once  the user can write the quiz, if user try to login again then user will be not allowed to take quiz, he will be allowed to check score and user can evaluate the quiz which were wrong and can rectify error

The project is completely built by using reactjs,bootstrap and mysql database connections, All details of users will be stored in the database, In the Login page user will be able to select options like forgot password and user registration. Users should Register before attempting a quiz only after a successful registration user will be allowed to take a quiz. If a user  forgets a password, the user will be asked  some parameters like dateofbirth, name,etc. Entered details will be checked with details in user registration, if entered details are matched correctly then the user can reset his password with a new password, this new password will be updated in the table of database. In the Second page after submitting no of questions the user is willing to attend based on input questions will be displayed totally we will have 30 questions. For Example, if a user selects 10 questions, we will try to give 10 random questions from 30 questions.

After completion of the quiz each and every response of a question is stored  in a table, and the score will be retrieved after completion of the quiz, score and name of user will be stored in a separate table so that one user can see others' score. By using various operations on databases, we will create and  insert data into tables for user registration, read details of user for checking login credentials, insert responses, display or fetch scores, update and delete password, and more crud operations will be used in this project
